----

== Development Workflow

=== Typical Development Cycle

1. *Start Development Environment*
[source,bash]
----
make setup        # First time setup
make run          # Start all services
----

2. *Make Changes*
* Edit code in your preferred IDE
* Use hot-reload for faster development
* Follow the package structure

3. *Test Changes*
[source,bash]
----
make test         # Run all tests
make demo         # Run demo scenarios
make check-status # Verify all services
----

4. *Monitor & Debug*
[source,bash]
----
make monitor      # Access monitoring dashboards
make logs         # Check application logs
----

5. *Iterate & Restart*
[source,bash]
----
make restart      # Restart services if needed
----

=== Best Practices

1. *Code Organization*
* Follow the package structure
* Keep components focused and small
* Add comprehensive tests

2. *Data Flow*
* Use schema evolution for compatibility
* Monitor data flow with metrics
* Handle errors gracefully

3. *Testing*
* Write integration tests for flows
* Use TestContainers for dependencies
* Test both success and failure cases

4. *Monitoring*
* Check metrics regularly
* Set up alerts for issues
* Monitor data quality

== Demo Scenarios

=== 1. Customer Events Flow (Kafka → Iceberg)

This scenario demonstrates real-time customer event processing:

* Event generation
* Stream processing with Flink
* Storage in Iceberg tables

=== 2. Analytical Insights Flow (Iceberg → Kafka)

This scenario shows how to:

* Query Iceberg tables
* Process analytical results
* Stream insights back to Kafka

== Monitoring

The project includes comprehensive monitoring:

* Prometheus metrics
* Spring Boot Actuator endpoints
* Flink metrics

Access the monitoring interfaces:

* Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
* Spring Boot Actuator: http://localhost:8080/actuator
* MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001

== Testing

=== Running Tests

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew test
----

=== Integration Tests

The project uses TestContainers for integration testing:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew integrationTest
----

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

==== Service Status Check
Use the status check command to verify all services are running properly:
[source,bash]
----
make check-status
----

This will show the status of:
* Docker containers
* Application health
* Kafka topics
* MinIO connection

==== Known Issues and Solutions

1. *Kafka Connection Issues*
* *Symptom*: Cannot connect to Kafka
* *Solution*: Check if Kafka is running and accessible:
[source,bash]
----
make check-status
make logs  # Check Kafka logs specifically
----

2. *MinIO Connection Issues*
* *Symptom*: Cannot access MinIO or Iceberg tables
* *Solution*: Verify MinIO is running and credentials are correct:
[source,bash]
----
make check-status
make logs  # Look for MinIO-related errors
----

3. *Application Won't Start*
* *Symptom*: Spring Boot application fails to start
* *Solution*: Check prerequisites and logs:
[source,bash]
----
./scripts/check-prerequisites.sh
make logs
----

=== Debugging Tips

1. Use the monitoring dashboards:
[source,bash]
----
make monitor  # Shows URLs for monitoring tools
----

2. Check specific component logs:
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose logs kafka    # Kafka logs
docker-compose logs minio    # MinIO logs
----

3. Restart specific components:
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose restart kafka  # Restart only Kafka
make restart                  # Restart everything
----
