# Dependency Changes and Recommendations

## Changes Made

### 1. Java Version Compatibility
- Set both source and target compatibility to Java 21
- This aligns with Kotlin's current JVM target support

### 2. Repository Configuration
- Added official Apache Iceberg Maven repository: `https://artifacts.iceberg.apache.org/maven/`
- Maintained other essential repositories including Maven Central and Apache repositories

### 3. Dependency Versions
- Updated Apache Iceberg dependencies to version 1.7.1
- Aligned Flink dependencies to version 1.20.0
- Updated Flink Kafka connector to match Flink version

### 4. Dependency Exclusions
- Maintained exclusion of kafka-clients from flink-connector-kafka to avoid version conflicts

## Recommendations

### 1. Version Compatibility
- Monitor Iceberg and Flink compatibility as new versions are released
- Consider upgrading to newer versions when they become available and are stable

### 2. Testing
- Run comprehensive tests after dependency changes
- Pay special attention to Flink job execution and Iceberg table operations

### 3. Future Considerations
- Keep track of Kotlin's Java version support for future upgrades
- Monitor Spring Boot compatibility with Java versions
- Consider implementing dependency version catalogs for better version management

## Known Issues
- Java 23 is not yet supported by Kotlin, falling back to Java 21
- Some Gradle features are deprecated and will be incompatible with Gradle 9.0

## Build Issues and Solutions

### 1. Iceberg Runtime Dependency
- Issue: Could not find org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-flink-runtime-1.20:1.4.3
- Solution: 
  - Updated to version 1.4.2 which has better compatibility with Flink 1.20
  - Added official Apache Iceberg Maven repository

### 2. Flink Version Alignment
- Issue: Mismatched Flink component versions
- Solution: Aligned all Flink dependencies to version 1.20.0, including:
  - flink-connector-kafka
  - flink-streaming-java
  - flink-table components

### 3. Java Version Compatibility
- Issue: Java 23 compatibility issues with Kotlin
- Solution: Set both sourceCompatibility and targetCompatibility to Java 21

## Next Steps
1. Verify the build with the updated dependencies
2. Run integration tests to ensure compatibility
3. Monitor application performance with the new dependency versions
4. Consider implementing a dependency update strategy
